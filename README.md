# Crop-Fertilizer-Recommendation-System-using-ML
This project implements a Crop &amp; Fertilizer Recommendation System using machine learning techniques, developed as part of the AICTE Edunet-Shell Skills4Future program focused on Green Skills &amp; AI.
# Objective
The objective of this project is to build a recommendation system that:
Recommends suitable crops based on soil and climate conditions.
Suggests fertilizers to optimize crop growth based on soil nutrient levels.
# Technologies Used
**Python:** For data manipulation and machine learning.
**Pandas:** For data preprocessing and analysis.
**Scikit-Learn:** For machine learning algorithms.
**Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization.
**Jupyter Notebooks:** For interactive development.
# Features
Data preprocessing: Handle missing values, duplicates, and categorical data.
Machine learning models for crop and fertilizer prediction.
Data visualization to understand correlations and distributions.
Model evaluation using metrics like accuracy and precision.
